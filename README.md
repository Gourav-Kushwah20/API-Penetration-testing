## 📚 Learning Modules

### 📘 Module 1 — Application Programming Interface (API)
📄 File: [`001-Application Programming Interface (API).md`](001-Application%20Programming%20Interface%20(API).md)

Learn the foundation of APIs:

- ✅ What is an API?
- 🌐 Endpoints
- 🔁 HTTP Methods
- 📦 Request & Response Structure
- 📊 HTTP Status Codes
- 🔌 API Protocol Types (REST, SOAP, GraphQL)
- 🌍 Common API Use Cases
- ⭐ Why APIs are Important
- 🔐 Authentication Mechanisms
- ⚔️ API vs Traditional Web Apps

---

### 🧩 Module 2 — Object and Action in API
📄 File: [`002-Object and Action in API.md`](002-Object%20and%20Action%20in%20API.md)

Master how APIs are structured:

- 📦 What is an Object?
- ⚙️ What is an Action?
- 🔄 REST vs Non-REST Style
- 🏦 Banking API Examples
- ☁️ SaaS API Examples
- ⚖️ Object vs Action Comparison
- 🔐 Security Testing Perspective

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

Modern systems are:

- 🌐 API-driven
- 📱 Mobile-first
- ☁️ Cloud-native
- 🔄 Microservice-based

Understanding APIs deeply is essential for:

- 👨‍💻 Developers  
- 🔐 Security Engineers  
- 🐞 Bug Bounty Hunters  
- 🛡 Penetration Testers  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After completing both modules, you will:

- Understand how APIs are structured
- Identify objects and actions correctly
- Map endpoints efficiently
- Think in terms of authorization logic
